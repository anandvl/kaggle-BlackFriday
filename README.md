# kaggle-BlackFriday
Sample exploratory analysis of kaggle dataset

This hosts a Python notebook and is primarily written to experiment with linking notebooks to mybinder.org

You can view this notebook at [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anandvl/kaggle-BlackFriday/blob/master/Exploratory_analysis.ipynb) and if you wish to experiment with the code, you can execute it on mybinder from [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/anandvl/kaggle-BlackFriday/blob/master/Exploratory_analysis.ipynb), OR you can directly execute it on mybinder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/anandvl/kaggle-BlackFriday/master?filepath=Exploratory_analysis.ipynb)

[github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/anandvl/kaggle-BlackFriday/blob/master/Exploratory_analysis.ipynb) also works to view this notebook, but it is supposed to be slower.
